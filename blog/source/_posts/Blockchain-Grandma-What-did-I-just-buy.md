Grandma came to me with money to invest in cryptocurrencies. She'd heard all about the incredible rise of Bitcoin, and wants to try grabbing her piece of the blockchain.

Well Grandma, I've got good news! Your new rig may be what carries you into retirement. Any questions?

## Yeah! What on earth did I just buy?

A mining rig.

## What's a mining rig?

To understand this, you first need to know about _blockchains_.

In the simplest terms, a blockchain is an open ledger. When a transaction is performed on a blockchain, it is recorded for everyone to see in a record that cannot be changed. Bitcoin is a blockchain.

## So why don't I just buy Bitcoin?

You probably should, but [I'll leave that to you](https://coinsquare.io). Bitcoin is one of many cryptocurrencies. Many new currencies, like _Ethereum_ solve new problems that Bitcoin does not. They're not necessarily meant to replace or compete with Bitcoin, but rather _compliment_ it.

[Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) is a currency that is set to change the world. It is also spiking in value (up $500 from November). As with Bitcoin, you can simply purchase it off a reputable currency exchange. You can also _mine_ it like in the olden days of Bitcoin.

## What in tarnation is mining?

Remember that _ledger_ I was talking about? Making it transparent and _trustless_ is a tricky thing.

### Trustless?

This just means that you're never in a situation where you could get robbed.

Basically, in a blockchain, all the blocks are stored in computers, or _nodes_, all over the world. Together these nodes form a giant, distributed world-wide computer. This computer can never be turned off as long as there is demand. Transparency and honesty are maintained by all the individual nodes. As long as no single person controls 51% of the nodes, fraud is virtually impossible. 

### And what is mining?

Oh yes, back to mining...

The thing about a blockchain is that everyone wants use it. How do we decide who gets to add a new block to the chain? If you want to add a block, you need to show that you've done some work to earn the privilege.

Enter the _miner_.

[Proof-of-work algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash) were once considered a potential way to combat spam email. The idea was that you'd have to demonstrate you weren't abusing the amazing capacity to send out millions of emails at once. Proof-of-work shows that your computer solved a cryptographically complex puzzle and expended a little computing power. If you sent one email, you'd only be delayed by a second. You probably wouldn't even notice that your computer was working a little bit harder. Try doing that with a million emails! One second for every email makes spamming a lot more difficult.

It works the same with many blockchains. If you show some proof of work you will be rewarded with a bit of currency for enabling someone to add a new block to the chain.

So when we're talking about _cryptocurrencies_, this is what people are buying and selling - the opportunity to add a block to the chain.

### So my rig proves I did some work?

Exactly. Plug your rig in, turn it on, and press _Go_... it starts guessing at answers to a puzzle. If it guesses correctly, you are compensated with _coins_ or _tokens_. Bitcoin, for example, is one such token. _Ether_ as with Ethereum, is another. As with conventional mining, if there is demand, the cost of electricity is outpaced by the price of the coin and it becomes profitable to operate a rig and create money out of thin air.

As an added benefit a rig serves as an excellent space heater.

## Alright, so how do I get my money out?

There are lots of reputable coin exchanges. The one I've had the most success with is [coinsquare.io](https://coinsquare.io). Transaction fees are outrageous, but they are everywhere. This particular exchange is based in Toronto, so you don't have to worry about your money leaving the country.

To sign up for any exchange service, you'll need to provide government ID, proof of address, and banking info.

## Can I have some pictures for my wallet?

Sure thing, Grandma!
