The _Bula_ rig officially commenced mining Ethereum at 19:27 MST. It is an analog of the [Aloha Ethereum mining rig](/blog/2017/11/09/Ethereum-Mining-Rig-Prototyping-and-Market-Investigation/).

The hardware and software are playing nice together, but hashrates are underwhelming. Each RX580 is getting about 18 MH/s (108 MH/s total). I'll need to tinker a bit with the software and firmware.

What follows is the story of what it took to get the Radeon RX580 GPUs to work with the Asus Prime 7270-A motherboard. This is meant to serve as notes to my future self, and anyone else who might need a bit of help. See the _Appendix_ for system specs and debugging tips.

## Asus motherboard problems!

The Asus Z270-A motherboard caused me nothing but trouble. It turned a 20 hour job into a 40 hour job. Live and learn for next time...

Having assembled the rig and done some light testing, I plugged in my hand-crafted bootable USB to install all the necessary software. For this I was rewarded with messages like:

```
PCIe Bus Error severity=Corrected, type=Physical layer, id=00e0
```

Or sometimes this helpful info would flash by in the blink of an eye:

```
No suitable video mode found
Booting in blind mode Ubuntu
```

Half the time I couldn't even get into the BIOS because of some weird infighting between the GPUs and the motherboard's onboard video controller. Even getting to the `grub` menu is hit-and-miss when all 6 GPUs are connected. During software deployment, I was constantly unplugging and replugging GPUs and the monitor.

### Some background/debugging tips

I typically attach my GPUs in waves (power off, of course). I start with one GPU (or zero) connected when first installing Ubuntu. Then, with all the system software, drivers, and dependencies installed, I attach one GPU and power up. I repeat until something breaks or I run out of slots. This is the best way to debug software and identify faulty units.

Following this approach I discovered that I can't get into the BIOS if I have all six GPUs plugged in. As such, it's best to start with one.

### Symptoms

Basically, the following symptoms indicate a misconfigured (or unconfigured BIOS):

- If you connect more than 4 RX580 GPUs, you don't see the BIOS splash screen at boot.
- Though 6 GPUs may be connected, the hashrate of at least one will drop to zero after about 25 minutes

I discovered through systematic trial-and-error that with 4 GPUs connected in the short PCIe slots, everything works. It was always the cards connected to the longer PCIEx16 slots that would fail.

### Configure the BIOS

Getting four GPUs to work together is fairly simple. Getting all six Radeon RX580 GPUs to work with the Asus Prime 7270-A motherboard requires configuring the BIOS (remember, you can only have 4 GPUs plugged in for this to work for some reason).

[This excellent YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cd1qoTAHmA) shows you the configuration steps from begining to end. They are summarized below.

#### Miscellaneous Configuration

All configuration steps start by entering the _Advanced_ menu by pressing _F7_ on the keyboard. Find the _Platform Miscellaneous Configuration_ menu and disable everything. These instructions are summarized thusly:

- F7 -> Advanced -> Platform Misc Configuration: _Disable_ everything

Obviously, you don't need to start from scratch every time.

#### Update the firmware

Following the convention established in the previous section:

- F7 -> Advanced -> Tool -> ASUS EZ Flassh 3 Utility: _BIOS update_

You'll reboot after the update is complete. Watch the video to see how it works.

#### Configure PCIe slots

Most of these settings are set to _Auto_ by default:

- F7 -> Advanced -> System Agent Configuration -> DMI/OPI Configuration -> DMI Max Link Speed: _Gen2_

Go up a menu to get into _PEG Port Configuration_:

- F7 -> Advanced -> System Agent Configuration -> PEG Port Configuration -> PCIEX16_1 Link Speed: _Gen2_
- F7 -> Advanced -> System Agent Configuration -> PEG Port Configuration -> PCIEX16_2 Link Speed: _Gen2_
- F7 -> Advanced -> System Agent Configuration -> PEG Port Configuration -> PCIe Spread Spectrum Clocking: _Auto_

And then:

- F7 -> Advanced -> PCH Configuration -> PCI Express Configuration -> PCIe Speed: _Gen2_

Finally: 

- F7 -> Advanced -> Boot -> Above 4G Decoding: _Enabled_

### Edit the default Grub stuff

With all that BIOS stuff out of the way, `grub`, our infuriating bootloader must also be configured.

Again, with one (maybe two) GPUs plugged in, open the `/etc/default/grub` file with your favourite text editor. Find the line that starts with `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` and make it look like this:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash pci=nomsi"
```

Save and update `grub`:

```
sudo update-grub
```

Or, if that doesn't work, try:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash pci=noaer"
```

You'll have to run `sudo update-grub` again and reboot.

## Phew!

No one said mining is easy.

Having configured the BIOS and `grub`, start attaching RX580 GPUs to the Asus Z270-A motherboard one at a time. Power off before each new connection. Make sure the cards are talking with the motherboard by using the debugging commands in the Appendix.

## Conclusion

With all six GPUs connected, I still don't get the opportunity to enter the BIOS. I don't see the `grub` menu either. The rig boots, nonetheless.

I'm pretty unhappy about the low hash rates I'm getting, but I'm glad everything's working... even if performance is degraded.

Stay tuned...

#### The total in fiat: $4,000.35 CDN

### Software

I don't pay for software (nor do I steal it).

- Ubuntu Server 16.04.3
- Linux kernel v4.14
- AMDGPU-PRO 17.40
- `ethereum` via `apt`
- [ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer) from source


### Debugging

Reboot between installation and use these helpful commands to debug...

#### clinfo

This one comes with the RX580's `AMDGPU-PRO` drivers:

```
/opt/amdgpu-pro/bin/clinfo
```

#### General Ubuntu info:

See what your GPUs look like to the OS:

```
sudo lspci -vvvv
```

This will show you any OS errors on boot:

```
dmesg | grep -i gpu
```
